IF and SWITCH with Initialization:

The if and switch control structures now allow us to specify an initialization clause beside the usual condition or selection clause.

if(status s = check(); s != staus::success)
{
    return a;
}

status s = check() --> Initialization --> Constructor is called
As if-else finish destructor is called.

This initialized s state then valid for whole if statement or if-else statements.
Any value initialization inside if statement valid until end of then part and else part if any.
The destructor for respective object is called at the end of then-part or at the end of the else part.

For limiting scope for if or switch code segment is also one purpose for this initialization.

Any object being initialized must have name otherwise, the initialization creates and destroys a temporary
